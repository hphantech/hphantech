**Hey 👋**

I’m Hieu, a frontend developer based in the Netherlands.

I like building websites and figuring out how to make them better.
My goal is to become a full-stack developer and build complete apps from start to finish.

I also build random projects for myself to experiment and learn.

My main stack is React, TypeScript, and Tailwind, but I am currently working on other projects to learn more. 
My Favortite tools are: Milanote, Vscode, Github and figma

I’ve got several projects pinned here.
Some are polished, some are experiments.

**Fun facts**
- I train regularly at the gym
- I like anime
- I enjoy building things more than explaining them
- I have a dog name Mochi
